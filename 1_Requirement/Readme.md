## Introduction 
### Calendar
Calendar is a system of organizing days. This is done by giving names to periods of time, typically days, weeks, months and years. A date is the designation of a single, specific day within such a system. A calendar is also a physical record (often paper) of such a system. A calendar can also mean a list of planned events, such as a court calendar or a partly or fully chronological list of documents, such as a calendar of wills. 


# Features:-
    1. It displays a nicely formatted calendar of every month.
    2. You can find the day by entering the day, month and year. For example, if you enter day = 10, month = 03 and year = 1991, 
       it gives you the day ‘Sunday’.
    3. You can add the note for a particular day.
    4. If the given month has a note in it, it will display in that day.



# SWOT ANALYSIS :-
SWOT Analysis is a simple tool that can help you to analyze what your company does best right now, and to devise a successful strategy for the future. SWOT can also reveal areas of the business that are holding you back, or that your competitors could exploit if you don't protect yourself.



## a) Strengths 
Strengths are things that your Calendar does particularly well, or in a way that distinguishes you from your competitors
## b) Weaknesses
Weaknesses, like strengths, are inherent features of your projects, so focus on your people, resources, systems, and procedures. 
## c)  Opportunity
They usually arise from situations outside your organization, and require an eye to what might happen in the future.   
## d) Threats 
Threats include anything that can negatively affect your business from the outside, such as supply-chain problems, shifts in market requirements, or a shortage of recruits.
